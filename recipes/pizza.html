<p><strong>Pizza Dough</strong></p>
<p>This easy pizza dough recipe is great for beginners and produces a soft homemade pizza crust. Skip the pizza delivery because you only need 6 basic ingredients to begin!</p>
<p><em><b>Ingredients:</b></em></p>
<ul>
    <li>Yeast</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Flour</li>
    <li>Oil</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Cornmeal</li>
    <li>Italian seasoning blend</li>
</ul>

<p><em><b>Steps:</b></em></p>
<ol>
    <li>Whisk the warm water, yeast, and granulated sugar together in the bowl of your 
         stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow to 
         rest for 5 minutes. <em><b>If you don’t have a stand mixer</b></em>, simply use a 
         large mixing bowl and mix the dough with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula in the 
         next step.</li>
         <p></p>
    <li>Add the olive oil, salt, and flour. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. Turn the dough
         out onto a lightly floured surface. With lightly floured hands, knead the dough 
         for 5 minutes (for a visual, watch me do it in the video above). The dough can be a
         little too heavy for a mixer to knead it, but you can certainly use the mixer on low 
         speed instead. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with 
         your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. 
         If not, keep kneading.</li>
         <p></p>
    <li>Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray—just use the same bowl you used 
         for the dough. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. 
         Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough 
         to rise at room temperature for 60-90 minutes or until double in size.</li>
        <p></p>
    <li>Preheat oven to 475°F (246°C). Allow it to heat for at least 15-20 minutes as you shape the
         pizza. (If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.) Lightly grease 
         baking sheet or pizza pan with nonstick spray or olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal, 
         which gives the crust extra crunch and flavor.</li>
         <p></p>
    <li><em><b>Shape the dough: </b></em> When the dough is ready, punch it down to release any 
         air bubbles. Divide the dough in half. (If not making 2 pizzas, freeze half of the dough 
         for another time. See freezing instructions below.) On a lightly floured work surface using 
         lightly floured hands or rolling pin, gently flatten the dough into a disc. Place on prepared
         pan and, using lightly floured hands, stretch and flatten the disc into a 12-inch circle, 
         about 1/2-inch thick. If the dough keeps shrinking back as you try to stretch it, stop what 
         you’re doing, cover it lightly for 5-10 minutes, then try again. Once shaped into a 12-inch
         circle, lift the edge of the dough up to create a lip around the edges. I simply pinch the 
         edges up to create the rim. If using a pizza stone, place the dough directly on baker’s 
         peels dusted with cornmeal.</li>
         <p></p>
    <li>Cover dough lightly with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow to rest for a few minutes 
         as you prepare your pizza toppings.</li>
         <p></p>
    <li><em><b>Top & bake the pizza: </b></em> Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of
         the dough to prevent bubbling. To prevent the filling from making your pizza crust soggy, brush 
         the top lightly with olive oil. Top with your favorite toppings and bake for 13-15 minutes or until
         the crust is golden brown.</li>
         <p></p>
    <li>Slice hot pizza and serve immediately. Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator.
         Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza slices can be frozen up to 3 months.</li>
